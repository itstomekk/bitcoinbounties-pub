[**Bitcoin Connect**](https://bitcoin-connect.com) is an embeddable, open-source JavaScript library maintained by [Alby](https://getalby.com) that allows websites to easily integrate Bitcoin and Lightning functionalities. It provides a modal widget for user interactions, enabling seamless onboarding and transactions.

Currently, the Bitcoin Connect modal widget requires a mouse for navigation and interaction, limiting its accessibility. By improving keyboard accessibility, we aim to make the library more inclusive and user-friendly for all users, including those with disabilities who rely on keyboard navigation.
